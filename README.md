# Windows Terminal Setup
## Description
The idea is to have a centrilized setup for my Windows Terminal. Here I gather some Powershell scripts (may add some bash later) that carry the Terminal configs:

- Install Powershell 7
- Install WSL and Ubuntu
- Add the different themes and color schemes
- Modify the profiles (set one as default)

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- Run setup.ps1 (it will ask some questions about the config along the way)
